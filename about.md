Hi, I am Dan Park, a current student at Fullstack Academy in NYC!

Currently, I am dabbling in all things Javascript -- Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and React.
I can talk about my story more here, but for now -- this'll do.

Please email questions, comments, concerns to danielpark.487@gmail.com

Thanks for reading!
